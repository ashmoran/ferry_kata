# Ferry Kata

An attempt at implementing in code the Ferry Kata I did with Mark Kirchstein at a BarCamp Blackpool event. This was actually acted out by session participants that the audience "programmed". I probably forgot the rules we came up with so I may end up implementing something slightly different.
